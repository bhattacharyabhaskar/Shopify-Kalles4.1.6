The tradition has been passed to him from generation to generation. He is one of the thousands of artisans in the Banaras area that has not let this art form vanish in spite of growing challenges.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">✔️How many people do you need to weave a Banarasi Saree?<\/span><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">❇️As you saw in the video, it takes 2 person to make a Banarasi Saree.<br><\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">✔️How many days does it take to make one?<br><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">❇️It depends upon the design that you have. The more intricate the design is, the longer it takes. For us, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indyvogue.com\/collections\/banarasi\" target=\"_self\" style=\"color: rgb(74, 144, 226);\">Organza Banarasis <\/a>take anywhere from 4-5 days and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indyvogue.com\/collections\/banarasi\" target=\"_self\" style=\"color: rgb(74, 144, 226);\">Katan Banarasi<\/a> 2-3 days.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">✔️Technology has advanced so much. Why can't they use machines for weaving?<br><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">❇️A very good question. The answer lies in the all important thing that makes these sarees, the Silk. Pure Silk threads are soft and any attempt to put it through machine weaving breaks the thread. You might find similar looking sarees at a cheaper price but please be careful before you get them as they could be machine-made with polyester mixed threads that have greater tensile strength.<br><\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">✔️I saw some black \/ red mark at the bottom of the saree? Why do you have such defects?<br><\/span>❇️Each piece is handmade as you saw in the video and the weaving spans multiple days. In order to understand how much is left in completing the weaving of the saree, the artisans put a mark after certain interval, generally 1 yard. In this way they can keep track. Most of the times these marks are not visible but sometimes they remain. This is not a defect but an uniqueness of the piece that makes handloom different from other sarees.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">✔️How does IndyVogue help these artisans?<br><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">❇️One of the major issues in this industry is the presence of third parties who buy the sarees cheaply from the weavers and sell them to the bigger companies at a much higher price. They can do this because they provide loans to these artisans to buy raw material and in turn extorts them to sell the saree cheaply. This is where we, at IndyVogue, make the difference. <br>1. We do not buy from third parties, we get them directly from the weavers to maximize their profit.<br>2. We stock each and every item at our fulfillment center in Kolkata after the saree passes the Quality Check and pay the artisans upfront. NO CREDIT.<\/span><br><br><\/span>","text_align":"start","col_tb":"12","col_mb":"12"}}},"block_order":["template--16503946445033__9ab16778-7a8d-4831-9950-9fea6f450acf-1666013824f6844181-0","template--16503946445033__9ab16778-7a8d-4831-9950-9fea6f450acf-1666013824f6844181-1","template--16503946445033__9ab16778-7a8d-4831-9950-9fea6f450acf-1666013824f6844181-2"],"settings":{"design_heading":"1","heading_align":"t4s-text-center","top_heading":"","icon_heading":"las la-gem","top_subheading":"","tophead_mb":30,"space_h_item":"30","space_v_item":"30","space_h_item_mb":"10","space_v_item_mb":"10","layout":"t4s-container-wrap","cl_bg":"","cl_bg_gradient":"","mg":",,50px,","pd":"","mg_mb":",,30px,","pd_mb":"","use_cus_css":false,"code_cus_css":""}},"9ef561ad-85ee-4bf4-9856-9403347d9903":{"type":"top_heading","blocks":{"template--16503946445033__9ef561ad-85ee-4bf4-9856-9403347d9903-1666013849e2b3aa41-0":{"type":"bl_heading","settings":{"top_heading":"THE BANARASI SAGA"}},"template--16503946445033__9ef561ad-85ee-4bf4-9856-9403347d9903-1666013849e2b3aa41-1":{"type":"bl_subheading","settings":{"top_subheading":""}}},"block_order":["template--16503946445033__9ef561ad-85ee-4bf4-9856-9403347d9903-1666013849e2b3aa41-0","template--16503946445033__9ef561ad-85ee-4bf4-9856-9403347d9903-1666013849e2b3aa41-1"],"settings":{"design_heading":"1","heading_align":"t4s-text-center","layout":"t4s-container-wrap","cl_bg":"","cl_bg_gradient":"","mg":",,50px,","pd":"","mg_mb":",,30px,","pd_mb":"","use_cus_css":false,"code_cus_css":""}},"pf-b4061047":{"type":"pf-b4061047","settings":{}}},"order":["eeb6f298-b01f-4936-b2fb-f33690ada9d3","9ab16778-7a8d-4831-9950-9fea6f450acf","9ef561ad-85ee-4bf4-9856-9403347d9903","pf-b4061047"]}
